## Overview

This project was an exercise in creating an introductory web page featuring a dropdown menu that adapts to both desktop and mobile interfaces. The challenge was to implement hover states for all interactive elements, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices. Key skills applied in this project included the use of flexbox for layout management, TailwindCSS for styling, and ReactJS for dynamic state management. The project aimed to refine my understanding of responsive design, emphasizing desktop and mobile compatibility.

## My process

1. Mobile Responsive Design First
2. Mobile Responsive - Side tab with dropdown
3. Planning process using paint in Microsoft

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned

1. To ensure the background color extends all the way down the page in Tailwind CSS, you can apply a minimum height (min-h-screen) to the top-level <div> in your App component. This utility class ensures that the <div> will have at least the height of the viewport, thus extending the background color throughout the entire visible area of the page, regardless of the content's height.
